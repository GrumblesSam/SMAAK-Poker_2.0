# SMAAK Poker

## Description
Our website utilizes a poker npm package so that a user can play a simple game of poker. The user can create an account or simple log-in to play. The users account stores their game history and a running chip total. 
Our site provides simple mechanics and a relaxing environment.
Our initial development thoughts were to create a game or a social media clone. We ended up voting towards the poker game and wanted to impliment multiplayer that could be developed in the future.

User Story: As a poker player, I want an easy to use online app so that i can practice poker.
